# Installation

Phenome can be installed using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>. So we suggest you already have installed <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and NPM at your system.

Run this in terminal in your project folder:

```
npm i phenome --save
```

That is all about installation, now let's check [Phenome compiler API](api.html)
