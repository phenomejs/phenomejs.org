# Component Rendering / JSX

{{index}}

Phenome components use JSX for rendering. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript.

## `render()`

The `render()` method is __required__ method in a Phenome component.

When called, it should examine `this.props` and `this.state` and return one of the following types:

* __Element__. Typically created via JSX. For example, `<div />` and `<MyComponent />` are elements that instruct vdom engine to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.
* __String and numbers__. These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
* __null__. Render nothing.

The `render()` function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time itâ€™s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.

If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in `componentDidMount()` or the other [lifecycle methods](life-cycle.html) instead. Keeping `render()` pure makes components easier to think about.
